I was a scrum master at Nokia Siemens Networks, before I joined to Prezi. Next to my Scrum Master role there were Technical Lead and developer responsanilities too. So I couldn't be a SM full time. I felt that its not good, because I couldn't concentrate sloly to enhance the performance of the team therefore my team never reached its full potential. But it did a good job, the product quality raised in every week, so the management was happy. But I felt that if I were only be a SM then we could do better. I couldn't explain why, I just felt.
In Agile Testing Days 2013 I met with Andreas Schliep, who is a Certified Scrum Trainer & Coach. He told me two really good examples why your company should employ full time SMs.

First one:
In kindergarten your kids play football without a coach. This is totally normal, because they do it for fun. In elementary school your kids have a football coach he\she also teaches gymnastic, swimming, basketball and so on. This is fine. Your kids just want to play football for fun and excercise. In high school your kids have a football coach who is only teaching football but for several teams. This is super! The coach knows the rules and teaches your kids as much as they can do in one or two training/week. If your kids want to be professionals they can reach that with hard work on their free time. However in the A league where the sponsors want their money back tenfold, the coach only have to/allowed to teaches one team, so he\she can bring out the most from them. Have you ever questioned why in the A league they have one coach/team? I have never. Because I want to see professional football play when I sit down to watch an A league play.
So please choose your league where you wanna play first and in accordance with your decision choose the responsibilities of your scrum master.

Second one:
In small town or in village there are usually 1-2 police. Most of the time, lets say 6 hors from 8, they are just sitting in front of their desk and waiting for calls. And of course in the remaining 2 hours they are doing patrols, saving kittens, capturing bad guys etc. So the logical conclusion would be that they should do some other works in their free time(in that 6 hours). For example they could bake breads. So in this case what you think how fast they could react to an emergency? How fit they would be after 6 hours of baking? Would they be able to capture pickpockets? Could they improve their skills in the police field during baking? No and no and no.

Next time when you hire a SM then think through these two stories befoure you tell the responsibilities connected to his/her role.
